  <h1>Climate Change: Crops Impact on Economy</h1>
  <p class="description">
    Our project focuses on the profound impact of climate change on crop production, which directly influences the agricultural
    industry and the broader economy of the United States. In recent years, rising global temperatures have disrupted traditional
    farming cycles, leading to unpredictable yields and a decrease in the production of key crops such as wheat, corn, and soybeans.
    Prolonged droughts, more frequent heatwaves, and erratic rainfall patterns have made farming more challenging, reducing both
    the quantity and quality of crops grown.
  </p>

  <p class="description">
    This decline in crop production not only threatens food security but also drives up the cost of basic agricultural products.
    For the younger generation, this means an increased cost of living as staples like bread, cereals, and fresh produce become
    less affordable. The rising cost of food disproportionately impacts low-income families, widening the economic divide and posing
    long-term challenges to health and well-being.
  </p>

  <p class="description">
    As climate change accelerates, the younger generation is also inheriting a farming industry that faces unprecedented risks and
    uncertainties. Reduced crop yields mean smaller profits for farmers, leading to higher prices throughout the supply chain.
    This economic pressure may discourage future investment in agriculture, further exacerbating food shortages and economic instability.
    Through this project, we aim to highlight the urgency of adopting sustainable agricultural practices and climate adaptation strategies.
    By analyzing trends in crop production and their economic impact, we hope to foster awareness and inspire solutions that can safeguard
    the future of food security for generations to come.

 <h2>Taking a Look into the Patterns</h2>

  <p class="description">
    This map shows the the areas where majority of the US agirculture states. We see 9 states that produces crops with different ranges.
    The color intesity shows how much is that state crop production is in factors.

  <div id="line-graph"></div>
  <p class="description">
    This graphs is showing us the graph of CO2 Emission is being produced each year just by focusing on the United States alone.
    We see a major incline in the 1900s to present date indicating there have been increasing growth the temperature in the United States.
